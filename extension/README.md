# Quick Search â€“ Chrome Extension

## ðŸ“– Overview
Quick Search is a Chrome extension to search content faster inside websites.  
It started as a small experiment after watching beginner tutorials and evolved into a tool that can:
- Search from a popup input.
- Search in a small local JSON database.
- Search directly in the page DOM.
- Jump to the section containing the result.

## ðŸ›  Features
- **Popup Search Bar** â€“ Triggered from the extension icon.
- **Local Search** â€“ Works with a small database (`search.json` or similar).
- **Website Search** â€“ Uses DOM queries (`document.querySelectorAll`) to scan the page.
- **Auto-scroll** â€“ Clicking a result scrolls to the matching section.
- **Planned Web Crawling** â€“ Follow internal links and search multiple pages.

## ðŸ“š Lessons Learned
- **Inspect the Right Context** â€“ The popup has its own dedicated developer tools panel.  
  Itâ€™s important to inspect the popup itself rather than the main page when debugging popup behavior.

- **Start Small** â€“ Begin with a simple local JSON search before moving on to live DOM search.  
  This made debugging easier and kept progress steady.

- **Root Structure Simplicity** â€“ Keep files in the root folder instead of using a `public/` folder when not required.  
  This avoids confusion from build systems like Vite.

- **Permissions vs. Capabilities** â€“ `all_frames` permission allows scripts to run in iframes,  
  but it doesnâ€™t guarantee access to their DOM if cross-origin restrictions apply.

- **Cross-Origin Challenges** â€“ PDFs or iframes loaded from other domains require special handling due to CORS limitations.  
  A different approach (e.g., server-side processing) might be needed for these cases.
